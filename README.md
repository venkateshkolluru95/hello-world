A new hello world repo
My research mainly focuses on studying eco-hydrological aspects related to grassland degradation, vegetation dynamics, land cover land use change, coupled natural and human systems, climate-vegetation interactions and socio-economic changes through the application of remote sensing and geospatial technologies. My current research links my eco-hydrology background with socio-ecological perspectives to study and understand the food, energy and water nexus changes in Mongolia and Kazakhstan.
